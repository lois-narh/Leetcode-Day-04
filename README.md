# Palindrome Number Checker (JavaScript)

This is a simple JavaScript program that checks whether a given number is a palindrome — a number that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., 121, 1331, etc.).

## What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

Examples:
- 121 → Palindrome (true)
- 100 → Not a palindrome (false)
